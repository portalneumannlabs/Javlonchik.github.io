                        <p class="paragraph-text">Hello! My name is Javlonbek Kosimov. I am from the capital of
                            Uzbekistan, Tashkent City. I am 22 years old. Currently I am doing my bachelor degree at
                            Eotvos Lorand University in Computer Science major. I am interested in programming, web
                            development. In 2018, I finished my study at lyceum, where I have spent a lot of time and
                            effort learning subjects which reflect my interests and preferences. My interest in this
                            sphere began when I first came into contact with computer coding at school, while creating a
                            small website. From there on, I was captivated and started watching different lectures
                            available online, working on small projects. After that I started learning and reading a lot
                            about programming, technologies and everything related to Computer Science sphere. And now I
                            am studying in Computer Science major, and this is another brilliant opportunity for me to
                            open up my new skills and develop my programming skills and thinking.</p><br>

                <p>
                    I came from Uzbekistan, officially the Republic of Uzbekistan,
                    is a doubly landlocked country in Central Asia. It is surrounded by five landlocked countries:
                    Kazakhstan to the north; Kyrgyzstan to the northeast; Tajikistan to the southeast; Afghanistan to
                    the south; and Turkmenistan to the south-west. Its capital and largest city is Tashkent. Uzbekistan
                    is part of the Turkic languages world, as well as a member of the Organization of Turkic States.
                    Uzbek language is the majority-spoken language in Uzbekistan. Islam is the predominant religion in
                    Uzbekistan, most Uzbeks being Sunni Muslims.
                    Uzbekistan is a secular state, with a presidential constitutional government in place. Uzbekistan
                    comprises 12 regions (vilayats), Tashkent City and one autonomous republic, Karakalpakstan. While
                    non-governmental human rights organisations have defined Uzbekistan as "an authoritarian state with
                    limited civil rights",significant reforms under Uzbekistan's second president's
                    administration have been made following the death of the first president Islam Karimov. Owing to
                    these reforms, relations with the neighbouring countries of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan
                    have drastically improved. A United Nations report of 2020 found much progress
                    toward achieving the UN's sustainable development goals.
                    The Uzbek economy is in a gradual transition to the market economy, with foreign trade policy being
                    based on import substitution. In September 2017, the country's currency became fully convertible at
                    market rates. Uzbekistan is a major producer and exporter of cotton. With the gigantic
                    power-generation facilities from the Soviet era and an ample supply of natural gas, Uzbekistan has
                    become the largest electricity producer in Central Asia.From 2018 to 2021, the republic
                    received a BB- rating by both Standard and Poor and Fitch. Strengths indicated by
                    Brookings Institution include Uzbekistan having large liquid assets, high economic growth, and low
                    public debt. Among the constraints holding the republic back is the low GDP per capita.
                    Uzbekistan is a member of the CIS, UN and the SCO.
